Hi! My name is Chun Yao (Jim) Chang. I’m an incoming master student studying Computer Science at [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/), previously graduated from National Taiwan University (NTU) with B.S. Computer Science. I am generally interested in fields in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. In NTU, my research focused on natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing, discussing the methods to compress some state-of-the-art model. Previously, I’ve conducted SWE internships at [Funpodium](https://www.funpodium.net/?ul=t) and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, singing. During the summer/winter break, I enjoy traveling, doing some sightseeing in places not visited yet. I plan to take a road trip during the summer break in UCLA.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
